# SteamTradingCards

Program that automates the search for elements called 'trading cards' on the Steam gaming platform, showcasing proficiency in web scraping and automation. Implemented dynamic URL generation based on extracted Steam App IDs, ensuring adaptability to different game links. Utilized the requests library for HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and colorama for enhanced console outputs. 

This program helps us easily find the trading cards of the games that you want. It is ideal for farming, as it will allow us to calculate faster if the game is profitable or not. Very useful for when the game we are looking for has a common name, since we will get many results when searching in the market.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the program and enter the link of the games separated ONLY by a comma (","). Then the program will automatically open tabs with the trading cards. If the game does not have trading cards or the link entered is not correct, the program will indicate this respectively.

Example of how to use it:
Suppose we want to search for the trading cards for "The Witcher 3" and "Elden Ring".
What we should enter in the program would be:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/,https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/
